# ADR-004: GitHub

## Date: 2026-02-15

## Status: Accepted

## Context
We need a version control and collaboration platform for Buckeye Marketplace, an Ohio State-themed e-commerce
application. The platform must source code version control for React frontenf and .Net backend. It must have
issue tracking and project management features. It also must allow for collaboration between student and professor
to help student stay on track throughout the course of the project. We also want a widely adopted platform and a platform
that allows for AI usage and guidance. Our team has little experience with GitHub.

## Decision
We will use GitHub as our version control and collaboration platform. 

## Consequences 
Our team has used GitHub before and it is an industry standard so it is a critical skill to develop. GitHub has
strong collaboration tools. It also has seamless integration with Azure for automated deployments. There is a large
ecosystem and community support in GitHub. GitHub also has the ability to utilize artificial intelligent thought GitHub
CoPilot for Ai coding assistant, which should help to accelerate developement.
