# ADR-0001: React

## Date
02-15-2026

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a library for Buckeye Marketplace, a Ohio State themed e-commerce application
Our team has Java experience. The application we are creating will require intercative 
UI components (product listings, cart updates, checkout).

## What we decided
We will use React (with TypeScript) as our frontend framework

## Consequences
React is similar to Java, which our team has experience with. It also has a gentle
learning curve which will be beneficial for our team. React has a large ecosystem with
many pre-built components and a large community for support. Pre-built components will 
allow us to efficiently add important UI components. React is used by many professionals.
Intial learning curve will be needed to get comfortable with React.
