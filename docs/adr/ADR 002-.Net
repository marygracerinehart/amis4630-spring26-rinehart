# ADR-002: .NET

## Date: 2026-02-15

## Status: Accepted

## Context
We need a backend framework for Buckeye Marketplace, an Ohio State-themed e-commerce platform application.
We need the backend to hold the business logic. It will be needed for user authentification and authorization, 
processing cart and checkout request, and managing product inventory. Our team has familiarity in Java and object
oriented programming. We need a backend framework that will integrate wiell with frontend framework, like React.

## Decision
We will use .NET as our backend framework. We will use C# as our programming language. 

## Consequences 
There will be a learning curve but C# and .NET are similar to Java making the transition easier
for our team. C# catches errors at compile time resulting in fewer problems in production. .NET
provides built-in database access allowing the team to write code in C#, not SQL. .NET has excellent
performance and scalability. It is used by Fortune 500 companies and proven at massive scale. It is backed
by Microsoft and allows for seamless deployment to Azure.
