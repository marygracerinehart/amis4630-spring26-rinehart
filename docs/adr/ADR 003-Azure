# ADR-003: Azure

## Date: 2026-02-15

## Status: Accepted

## Context
We need a cloud hosting paltform for Buckeye Marketplace, an Ohio State-themed e-commerce application.
The platform must support hosting a React front and a .NET backend. We also need the platform
to be scalable for growth.

## Decision
We will use Microsoft Azure as our cloud hosting platform. 

## Consequences 
Azure has strong integration with .NET applications. It allows for one-click deployment from Visual Studio.
With built in scalability the application will be able to handle growth. It allows for an all in one platform 
for hosting, database, authentification, and monitoring all in the same place emliminating the need for multiple 
vendors. With a strong enterprise presence and the #2 cloud provider it is a good learning investment.
